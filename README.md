<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Horiseon Acessibility Overhaul&nbsp;</strong></span></h1>
<p>I believe that everyone is entitled to use the internet, regardless of any disabilities they might&nbsp;</p>
<p>have, so I've set out to overhaul all of Horieson's landing page code.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Motivation</strong></span></h2>
<p>I don't believe it's fair to exclude an entire group of people from being able to view or enjoy your&nbsp;</p>
<p>website simply because you were being lazy while developing it. To ensure everyone is included,&nbsp;</p>
<p>an accesibility overhaul was needed.</p>
